Description: Estimation and inference from generalized linear models
    based on various methods for bias reduction (see Kosmidis, 2014,
    WIRE computational statistics). The brglmFit fitting method can
    achieve reduction of estimation bias either through the adjusted
    score equations approach in Firth (1993, Biometrika) and Kosmidis
    and Firth (2009, Biometrika), or through the direct subtraction of
    an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator from
    the maximum likelihood estimates (Cordeiro and McCullagh,
    1991). In the special case of generalized linear models for
    binomial and multinomial responses, the adjusted score equations
    approach returns estimates with improved frequentist properties,
    that are also always finite, even in cases where the maximum
    likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and
    quasi-complete separation). Estimation in all cases takes place
    via a quasi Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the
    construction of of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias
    estimates are provided.
